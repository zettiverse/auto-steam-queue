# Auto Steam Queue

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

## Steps

1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (for Firefox or Chrome, respectively)
2. Install [userscript](https://github.com/3xz/auto-steam-queue/raw/master/auto_steam_queue.user.js)
3. Hit the [Steam explore page](http://store.steampowered.com/explore/).
4. Wait for the queues to run through by themselves and/or Explore your queue and watch it go to the next game for you.

## Idea

Initially, I made a fairly simple user script that "clicked" through a discovery queue as soon as the game's store page loaded. Soon after, many different users made suggestions and PRs to the script and it became a more well-rounded script. (Honestly, I hadn't anticipated such a reception so it's taken me awhile to actually get a proper GitHub repo up instead of some slapdash system I was using.)
